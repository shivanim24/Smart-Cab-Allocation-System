Smart Cab Allocation System for Efficient Trip Planning

Project Overview

The Smart Cab Allocation System is designed to optimize cab allocation and enhance trip planning efficiency by using real-time location data. It leverages Google Maps APIs and the Haversine formula for location-based cab searches, providing both admins and users with a seamless experience for booking and managing rides.

Features
1. Admin's Cab Allocation Optimization
Objective:
To develop an algorithm that optimizes cab allocation by reducing the overall travel distance between cabs and trip start locations.

Key Tasks:
An algorithm suggests the best cab based on proximity to the trip's start location.
Real-time location data for cabs and trip start points is integrated.
The algorithm is tested for minimizing travel distance and improving trip efficiency.


2. Employee/User's Cab Search Optimization
Objective:
Enhance the user experience by providing relevant and nearby cab suggestions.

Key Tasks:
Utilize real-time data to display cabs currently engaged in trips that are still nearby the user’s location.
Provide quick and accurate cab suggestions based on proximity and availability.


3. Real-Time Location Data Integration
Objective:
Ensure seamless integration of real-time data to improve the accuracy of cab allocation and tracking.

Key Tasks:
Set up real-time tracking for cab locations using Google Maps APIs.
Integrate location data into the cab allocation algorithm for real-time updates.
Handle potential issues like data latency and inaccuracies to maintain system reliability.

API Endpoints

Authentication APIs

POST /api/auth/register – Register a new user.
POST /api/auth/login – Login and receive a JWT token.
GET /api/auth/getUser – Get authenticated user details.

Cab APIs

POST /api/cabs/addCab – Admin adds a new cab.
GET /api/cabs/availableCabs – Fetch all available cabs for users.
POST /api/cabs/bookCab/:cabId – Book a cab by ID.
POST /api/cabs/endTrip/:cabId – End a trip by cab ID, making it available again.


Nearest Cab Algorithm
The system uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between the user’s location and available cabs. Cabs within the same pincode or within a 5 km radius are considered for the "nearest cabs" list.

const calculateDistance = (lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2) => {
    const R = 6371; // Radius of the Earth in km
    const dLat = deg2rad(lat2 - lat1);
    const dLon = deg2rad(lon2 - lon1);
    const a = 
        Math.sin(dLat / 2) * Math.sin(dLat / 2) +
        Math.cos(deg2rad(lat1)) * Math.cos(deg2rad(lat2)) * 
        Math.sin(dLon / 2) * Math.sin(dLon / 2);
    const c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1 - a));
    const distance = R * c; // Distance in km
    return distance;
};


Features
Real-Time Cab Tracking:
Users can track the live location of their booked cab through Google Maps, with an animation showing the cab's movement and ETA.

Booking & Trip Management:
Once a cab is booked, it is marked as unavailable for other users. Admins and users can track and end trips, updating cab availability.

Admin Dashboard:
Admins can manage cabs, Admins can also add new cabs by clicking on map locations.


Authentication
The platform uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication and Express Validator for data validation.

Example for JWT:

const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const authenticateUser = (req, res) => {
    const token = req.headers['authorization'];
    if (!token) return res.status(403).send('Token required');
    try {
        const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'your-secret-key');
        req.user = decoded;
        next();
    } catch (error) {
        return res.status(401).send('Invalid Token');
    }
};

Admin Credentials:
Email: admin@gmail.com
Password: 12345678


Prerequisites
Location-Enabled Devices:
The platform requires devices with location detection capabilities to find and track nearby cabs.

Google Maps API:
Ensure you have access to Google Maps services for cab location tracking and route display.
